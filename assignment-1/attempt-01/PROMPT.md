I want to make a web-based midi drum pad.

1. Get the Sturdel Web package - @https://codeberg.org/uzu/strudel/src/branch/main/packages/web
2. Have a 4\*4 pad as the UI. Darkmode colors, have it look something like a digitial version of a product form Teenage Engineering.
3. Have the pad mapped to 1234qwerasdfzxcv. so when the user presses q it will play the sound of column 1 row 2.
4. make a settings page to allow users to choose the sound. - use the sound options from Sturdel.
5. clicking the pad or pressing a mapped key on the keyboard should write a code in Sturdel.
