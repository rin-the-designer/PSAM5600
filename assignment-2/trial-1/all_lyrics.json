    "lyrics": "[Verse 1] I've been thinking That I got no idea what you're thinking Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? When it ended, I kinda hoped that it'd be open-ended But you never looked back Well, I guess you can't hold on to something once you let it go  [Pre-Chorus] But I know a place where we can be us I know it ain't real, but it's real enough From sun going down to sun coming up It's like you're here with me  [Chorus] Whenever I close my eyes It's taking me back in time Been drowning in dreams lately Like it's 2019, baby Whenever I'm missing you Call you up, but I can't get through Don't know where you sleep lately But I'll see you in my dreams, maybe We can catch up, drive down our old street If all that we were is all that we'll ever be It's bittersweet At least a girl can dream  [Verse 2] I guess that I'm taking what I can get 'Cause I don't get nothing new from your friends If you got the harder side of the break Then why is it harder for me to take? There's so much I might never get to say-ay  [Pre-Chorus] But I know a place where we can be us I know it ain't real, but it's real enough From sun going down to sun coming up It's like you're here with me  [Chorus] Whenever I close my eyes It's taking me back in time Been drowning in dreams lately Like it's 2019, baby Whenever I'm missing you Call you up, but I can't get through Don't know where you sleep lately But I'll see you in my dreams, maybe We can catch up, drive down our old street If all that we were is all that we'll ever be It's bittersweet At least a girl can dream  [Bridge] I know it's only in my mind (Ooh) Playin' three nights on the stereo Like a movie scene, DiCaprio Oh, I put my makeup on just to fall asleep (Ah) It's like you're here with me  [Chorus] Whenever I close my eyes It's taking me back in time Been drowning in dreams lately Like it's 2019, baby Whenever I'm missing you Call you up, but I can't get through Don't know where you sleep lately But I'll see you in my dreams, maybe We can catch up, drive down our old street If all that we were is something we'll never be It's bittersweet Can we be friends at least?
